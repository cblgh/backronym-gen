Backronym Generator

Generates a backronym from a specified dictionary file.

The config file config.me:
The first line in config.me is the acronym you want to generate a backronym
for.
The second line is the path of the dictionary file, from which you will
generate the backronym.

The dictionary file:
# at the start of a line is a comment, and will be skipped
- prepended to a word means that it will be added to the word before it
e.g. lund hacker -space will yield Lund Hackerspace

Otherwise just pump the file full with words that start with the same letter
as one of the letters of your acronym!

Running the script returns a valid json string via stdout.
